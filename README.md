## Timed Quiz with Code Related Questions

### Overview:
In this repository I created a timed code related quiz.  The quiz consists of 5 questions that will ask basic code questions.  The quiz gives you 75 seconds to answer all five questions and then saves your score when you complete it. This was primarily accomplished using Javascript web API's to manipulate DOM Elements.
